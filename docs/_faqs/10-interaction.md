Glad you asked!

- Start a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP), or upgrade your VDP or bug bounty program to **include best practices like Safe Harbor and proactive disclosure timelines**  
- **[Join the community,](https://community.disclose.io)** contribute or assist with vulnerability research, and help finders connect with security teams to alert them of identified risks  
- Help us **keep "The Big List" of known VDPs and bug bounty programs up-to-date** by submitting a PR to the dioterms repo   
- **Contribute to the dioterms open-source vulnerability disclosure policy** by raising an issue on the repo... or add a language or regional legal translations by submitting a PR  
- **Volunteer as a core contributor/maintainer** on one of our existing projects  
- **Recommend a new project** to support our mission the make vulnerability disclosure safe, simple, and standardized.
